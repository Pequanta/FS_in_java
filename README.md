# FS_in_java
This is a FileSystem I built as a means to learn java with practice. In the program I used LinkedList struction to build the file system and stack data structure to 
deal with the traversals. I used Swing to deal with the gui and java's builtin standard library , i.e. File to retrive files and directories.
